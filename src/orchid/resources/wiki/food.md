## Recipe
Each of these recipes have been used by me multiple delicious times. :)

The steps for each recipe have been overly simplified. My method of cooking doesn't require such precision.

### Chocolate Brownies
| Ingredients              |
| ------------------------ |
| 1/2 cup butter, softened |
| 1 cup white sugar        |
| 2 eggs                   |
| (optional) 1 tsp vanilla extract  |
| 1/2 cup flour            |
| 1/3 cup cocoa powder     |
| (optional) 1/4 tsp salt  |
| (optional) 1/4 tsp baking powder  |

1. Preheat oven to 350° F
2. In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar, then mix in eggs and vanilla
3. In a medium bowl, mix flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder
4. Gradually blend dry ingredients into the large bowl
5. Put mixture in 9x9 aluminum-foil-lined pan, then bake for 20-25 minutes

Tip:
- The aluminum foil helps the brownie to stay moist, as opposed to drying out more on the edges

### Sugar Cookies
| Ingredients              |
| ------------------------ |
| 1.25 cups flour          |
| 1 tsp baking powder      |
| 1/2 cup butter, softened |
| 3/4 cup white sugar      |
| 1 egg                    |
| 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  | 

Let's begin!
1. Preheat oven to 375° F
2. In a medium bowl, mix flour and baking powder
3. In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar, then add eggs and vanilla
4. Gradually blend dry ingredients into the large bowl
5. Put dough on aluminum-foil-lined cookie sheets
6. Bake for 8-10 minutes, then let cool on sheets for 2 minutes

Tip:
- For gooey-er cookies, don't press down on the cookie on the pan
- Cookies may not look done in the oven, but that's okay for soft cookies
- Using 1/4 cup less flour means the cookies will flatten more when cooking (I ran out of flour and I wanted cookies! :p) 

### Pancakes
| Dry Ingredients     | Wet ingredients |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1 cup flour         | 1 egg           |
| 2 tbsp sugar        | 1 cup milk |
| 2 tsp baking powder | 2 tbsp butter (softened) or oil |
| 1 tsp salt          | (Optional) 1 tsp vanilla extract |

Let's begin!
1. In a medium bowl, mix the dry ingredients
2. In a large bowl, mix the wet ingredients
3. Mix all ingredients in the large bowl
4. Cook on a greased pan (or 2 pans)

Tip:
- In order to keep all pancakes warm until the end, keep the finished pancakes warm in 200° oven, covered in aluminum foil
- Over-mixing results in flatter pancakes
- For fluffier pancakes, replace the water/milk with plain sparkling water
- Adding twice as much baking powder showed no noticable difference

### Loaded Nachos
1. In a large plate or serving plate, add nachos, salsa, chopped bell peppers, guacamole, rinsed and drained black beans, and a drizzle of queso.
2. (Optional) Squeeze a few wedges of lime over the nachos.

| Pizza sauce              |
| Mozzarella cheese        |
| Oil                      |
| Salt and pepper          |
| Optional pizza toppings  |

Let's begin!
1. Slice 1/2 inch thick sweet potato rounds
2. Toss with oil, salt, and pepper
3. Place on parchment paper lined baking sheets and roast for 35-40 minutes at 375 F, flip after 25 minutes
